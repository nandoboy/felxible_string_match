#Flexible string mathcing for google and amazon products
Product names across sites may vary at a character level. Flexible string matching techniques may be required for providing
matches of varying degrees from which we may pick the ones with the greatest degree of match. The measure used here, inverse 
document frequncy, weights matches inversely by the frequency with which the matching word appears in its document. A match of 
one wird with another that appears quite rarely carries much more weight than a match of the same word with one that occurs 
more frequently. Further enhancements like tf-idf may applied.
